# CoRE-MOF CR/NCR benchmark workflows

This repository-scoped skill is deliberately limited to the portable ML
benchmark. It contains no original-host paths, scheduler state, licensed-node
configuration, or release-production instructions.

For a read-only metadata request, use `examples/read_release_metadata.py` or
`examples/read_checker_results.py` and the matching
[database access guide](../../../README_DATABASE_ACCESS.md). Reading recorded
checker outcomes does not run the checkers and needs no checker engines or
CCDC installation. This route does not require the historical handoff below.
Keep archive publication catalogues distinct from the file-level catalogue
accepted by `CoREMOF.retrieval.fetch_release`.

Use the database name **CoRE-MOF-COD**. Release CoRE IDs have the form
`YYYY[elements][topology]dimension[variant]serial`; use `CoREMOF.parse_core_id`
and obtain source/access categories from metadata, never from the filename.
CoRE IDs are distinct from chemical MOFid-v1/v2 strings. Do not reinterpret
descriptive name tokens as grouping evidence. Established IDs are persistent
by default; metadata changes alone do not trigger renaming. An unavailable
`[nan]` topology may be updated only with explicit user approval, a validated
unambiguous named CrystalNets SingleNodes result and a collision-free serial
allocated from the maintained destination-name registry. Read the CoRE-ID
section of the database access guide before updating all current
identifier-bearing artifacts consistently. Parsing and formatting do not
authorize or execute these updates. Retired aliases and historical crosswalks
stay private and outside releases. When replaying frozen experiments,
validate and preserve translated membership and assignments rather than
rerunning a sampler with newly sorted identifiers.

## Choose the requested workflow

- **New target-first benchmark:** read
  [the target-first guide](../../../docs/source/target_first_benchmark.rst).
  Use `examples/build_target_first_benchmark.py` to merge declared targets,
  determine finite eligibility, build the requested cohorts, attach targets
  and write the complete workflow receipt. Required endpoint availability may
  select eligible structures; target magnitudes never determine grouping,
  diversity or assignments. Full-release grouping and checker-label purity
  precede that eligibility filter. The explicit current partition profile is
  `transition_balanced`; do not change legacy API defaults.
- **Reproduce transferred assignments/results:** use the exact dataset,
  checker-evidence revision, code, settings and assignment digest named by that
  transfer's prompt and manifest. A newer metadata or target table is not
  permission to replace a frozen experiment. Verify only the ledgers named by
  the supplied handoff; do not substitute a historical guide's counts/seeds.
- **Historical target-independent construction:** the September 4 handoff
  below deliberately freezes membership before targets are attached. Read
  `ML_BENCHMARK_HANDOFF.md` for this route only. Its counts and 30-run design
  are historical, not defaults for the current paper or a new target-first run.

The target-first workflow receipt must connect target sources and endpoint
definitions, the finite-eligibility rule and ID digest, the full-release
grouping/checker view, requested settings, split digest and attached outputs.
An eligibility-ID list alone does not document why those IDs were selected.
Input preprocessing for a model is separate and must never silently drop rows
from a frozen benchmark. An incomplete output directory without the workflow
receipt is not a successful dataset.

## Historical September 4 handoff: exact bindings

1. Treat the Git clone as the source root. Read `ML_BENCHMARK_HANDOFF.md`
   completely before running the benchmark.
2. Obtain the separately transferred restricted handoff from the project
   coordinator. Do not expect release tables or targets in Git.
3. Verify the archive SHA-256 before extraction, then verify the extracted
   top-level `SHA256SUMS` and every nested ledger named by
   `TRANSFER_MANIFEST.json`.
4. Compare the manifest's exact repository URL, branch, commit, package
   version, and source-file hashes with the checkout. Stop on any mismatch;
   do not select a similarly named commit or data directory by date.
5. Use Python 3.9--3.11 and install `.[benchmark]`. Run `coremof doctor` and
   require the exact five-package backend recorded by the guide and manifest.
6. Keep the extracted handoff and all derived assignments outside Git.

The transferred snapshot is intentionally current-finished rather than a
completed target campaign. Preserve its coverage/error/null accounting and all
false completion, promotion, publication, and official flags. Never fill a
missing target from another structure, campaign, or unit convention.

## Historical handoff: freeze target-blind assignments

Strict computation-ready (CR) means MOFClassifier, original MOFChecker,
Chen--Manz, MOSAEC, and SETC-GAT are all available and PASS. Strict
non-computation-ready (NCR) means those same five results are all available and
FAIL. Any missing, timed-out, failed, unsupported, or otherwise
`NOT_AVAILABLE` result is a non-vote that makes the row UNCHECKED; it never
becomes FAIL or NCR. A complete mixture of PASS and FAIL is AMBIGUOUS.

For `group_criteria="priority_main"`, `priority_main` is the conflict-aware
explanatory hierarchy: exact available 264-value depth-5 RAC5 groups seed
components, then exact complete MOFid-v2 and MOFid-v1 groups attach unresolved
rows. A weaker group touching multiple stronger components records
`PARENT_METHOD_CONFLICT` and does not merge them; missing evidence remains a
singleton. It excludes targets, Zeo++, CrystalNets, source identifiers, CIF
hashes, and StructureMatcher.

The separate `main_union` leakage guard is the transitive connected-component
union constructed over the complete release before any label, source, variant,
metal, ID, or target filtering. Its direct edges come from exact full CIF SHA-256,
database-namespaced source siblings, and available release-authorized exact
RAC5, MOFid-v2, and MOFid-v1 edges. It is a partition guard, not an explanatory
parent or identity claim. The benchmark adds the requested criterion edges and
takes connected-component closure; every resulting effective leakage block is
indivisible across train, validation, and test.

The checksum-bound CoRE-MOF-COD integration has 6,294 raw strict CR and 2,299 raw
strict NCR rows. Some share an effective block with another checker label, so
the default must fail closed. Explicitly request
`complete_release_label_pure_effective_blocks`: it excludes 1,601 CR and 572
NCR rows and leaves eligible pools C=4,693 and M=1,727. This is a sensitivity
cohort, not relabeling and not the complete strict population. At NCR-pool
fraction q, select `round_half_up(q*M)` NCR and
`C-round_half_up(q*M)` CR rows; q=1 is 1,727 NCR plus 2,966 CR, not a 100%-NCR
cohort. Recompute and verify all counts from the bound release.

Run the exact command from `ML_BENCHMARK_HANDOFF.md`. The representative
diversity profile may read only complete finite RAC5, otherwise the declared
complete Zeo++ vector, otherwise the explicit no-numeric tier. It must never
read adsorption values or target availability. It requires exact NumPy
1.26.4, scikit-learn 1.5.0, SciPy 1.13.1, joblib 1.5.3, and threadpoolctl
3.6.0; numerical libraries run with a one-thread limit and the receipt records
their non-path runtime identity. Cross-architecture bit identity is not
guaranteed, so compare receipts and retain the frozen assignment digest.

Require all 30 requested runs, one identical whole-block pure-CR test across
ratios and seeds, zero crossed effective blocks, q=1 containing every eligible
NCR row, zero partially selected blocks, and `official_split=false`. The
supplementary `full_cr_diagnostic` covers the complete raw strict-CR pool,
including policy-excluded rows; it is not the independent paper test.

## Historical handoff: attach targets only after freeze

Verify the benchmark `SHA256SUMS`, suite receipt, release binding, and frozen
assignment digest before opening the target table. Prefer the independently
audited combined as-of-cutoff snapshot, not the completion-only current-results
view. Build it with `examples/build_combined_target_dataset.py`, require exact
release/source hashes and expected counts, rebuild independently, and audit it
with `examples/audit_combined_target_dataset.py --comparison-dataset` before
promotion.
Both utilities require the externally supplied dataset identity contract and
its independently verified SHA-256; see `COMBINED_TARGET_DATASET.md` for the
exact base/additions phase and version expectations. Read `COMBINED_TARGET_DATASET.md` for the current count and null
contract.

At cutoff `2026-09-04T05:43:23Z`, the combined exact-ID left join spans all
42,574 recorded structures and has 28,979 finite CH4, 28,974 finite H2, and
28,944 finite raw CO2/N2 Widom-ratio labels. The earlier 2,335 / 3,744 / 14,167
counts are new current-finished evidence only, not total target availability.
`HISTORICAL_SCIENTIFIC_NULL` means the frozen source status is `EXISTING` with
`explicit_null=true` and a nonempty diagnostic; it remains eligible but
unavailable/native-null and cannot be filled because only `MISSING` keys accept
current results. The current combined snapshot has one historical Widom
`ZERO_DENOMINATOR`, so the finite count is one below the raw-existing-plus-new
arithmetic.

Use the target config from the restricted snapshot with `missing="keep"` unless
the analysis contract explicitly requires another policy. `keep` preserves
every assigned ID and a native null for unavailable targets. `drop` makes only
a derived filtered view; it must not refill, rebalance, or resplit.

The CLI attaches one `runs/<run_key>.csv` at a time using the suite
`receipt.json`; `membership_manifest.csv` repeats IDs across runs and is not
an attachment manifest. For all runs together, use
`suite.attach_targets(...)` in Python before serialization or loop over the
per-run CSVs. Target hashes never enter or alter the original assignment
receipt, and every derived output keeps `official_split=false`.

## Publication and reporting boundary

- Keep release tables, checker evidence, structure-resolved targets, and
  derived manifests in the approved restricted transfer area. Do not commit
  them, add them to Git LFS, or upload them to an unapproved public cloud.
- This prepared Git surface excludes local lookup tables, SI archives, node
  structures and model assets. An authorized local copy may contain ignored
  files that are absent from a clone. Consult `UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` and
  `LOCAL_ASSETS.json`; do not force-add those assets or infer permission from
  their presence on the workstation.
- Confirm recipient rights, institutional CSD/CCDC entitlement, and
  asset-specific redistribution terms before moving CSD, SI, MOSAEC, or other
  licensed-derived content.
- Report raw, excluded, eligible, missing/null/error, and endpoint coverage
  separately. The historical snapshot and sensitivity cohort described above
  are not a replacement for the frozen paper experiment. Exploratory
  assignments are not official release splits, and a full-CR diagnostic with
  training overlap is not an independent test. Report completion only for the
  exact experiment and endpoint matrix supported by its verified records.
